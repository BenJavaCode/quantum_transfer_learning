This is a project i did in extension with my other projects where i use the cifar-10 dataset. The reason i did this project is to explore the capabilities of quantum-ml models.
If you are interested, you can view some of the other projects, where i train a model from scratch, or the more related ones where i used transfer learning in different ways.




# I have uploaded a new version in the branch 26-11-2020,  where i have made som minor improvements and also added some more explanations and reflections, for those of you 
who might be interested.
